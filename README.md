## Backend

For the backend part I used SpringBoot 3.3.3 and some dependencies such as lombok. For the connection with the database I used MongoDB dependency.

For the frontend part we will use react and as a style framework we will use bootstrap. As a way to communicate the frontend and the backend we will use JSON format
